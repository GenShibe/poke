# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
iamashley@duck.com (E-mail) https://discord.gg/pfKSQ3pMfW (Discord server).
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

Certainly, here's the revised text with a new section that addresses authoritarianism and the inclusion of "authoritarianism" in the Definitions section. Additionally, I've moved "Protected Characteristics" to the Definitions section as requested:

## Additional Terms for Poketube

**TL;DR**: You are not allowed to edit or remove these terms from Poketube. You can't remove this file from your Poketube fork. Everyone can copy and share this document as is, but making changes is not allowed. If your chosen alternative code of conduct doesn't include provisions against hate speech, inappropriate behavior, anti-immigrant sentiments, far-right, far-left, or authoritarian content, it's not allowed.

1. Definitions

- **"Alternative Code of Conduct"**: This refers to a code of conduct other than the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct.

- **"Free Software"**: The definition of "free software" is in accordance with the GNU GPL version 3. You can find a complete copy of it in the LICENSE file.

- **Hate Speech**: Hate speech includes any communication, whether written, spoken, or expressed in any form, that promotes discrimination, hostility, or violence against individuals or groups based on attributes such as race, ethnicity, gender, religion, or other protected characteristics.

- **Inappropriate Behavior**: Inappropriate behavior encompasses actions or expressions that create an unwelcome, hostile, or offensive environment for others, such as harassment, intimidation, or bullying.

- **Authoritarianism**: Authoritarianism is characterized by an emphasis on strong central authority, limited individual freedoms, and restrictions on democratic processes. Content or behavior that promotes authoritarian principles, suppresses freedom of speech, individual rights, or democratic values is strictly prohibited.

- **Protected characteristics** include attributes such as race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, disability, and other traits or qualities safeguarded from discrimination by relevant laws and regulations. This defines what is meant by "protected characteristics" in the context of this document.

2. Terms

You are strictly prohibited from editing, removing, or altering the terms of this file in any way, shape, or form. Furthermore, you may not remove this file from your fork of Poketube. While everyone is allowed to make verbatim copies of this document and distribute it, modifying it is not permitted.

**3. Prohibition of Anti-Immigrant and Far-Right Content**

Content that promotes or glorifies anti-immigrant sentiments or far-right ideologies is strictly prohibited. This includes any content that discriminates against immigrants or supports extremist ideologies on the far-right.

**4. Modification of Terms**

These terms may be subject to change, and any updates will be communicated to the Poketube community. Changes to these terms will be communicated to users.


**6. Application of GNU Kind Communication Policy**

These terms also apply the principles outlined in the [GNU Kind Communication Policy](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/kind-communication.html), which encourage respectful and inclusive communication within the Poketube community.

--------------------
We have implemented these requirements in response to the recent Polymc event (you can find information about this event online). We understand that this may raise concerns, but our intention is to prevent the proliferation of troll forks of Poketube.

It is crucial to note that Poketube is not a political software, and we respect the diverse opinions and beliefs of our users.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.
